We need to support tag manager for helping in discussion foram where students can add tags while asking for question or
adding reply to some questions.

Operations needed to be supported in tag-manager are:
1. Insert Tag
2. Delete Tag
3. Delete Based on regex
4. Update Tag
5. Get Tags


Violation:
One Solution is to write a tag manager class which will have methods for all the above operations, which will be
correct functionally, but it has a lot of design flows.
