-> we can easily add any number of superHero without any change needed in Attacker class
-> Attacker class also has no need to have any info about the concreate class like 'SuperMan' or 'Batman'
-> Attacker class is coded against 'SuperHero' abstract class

=> One thing we can always do to ensure that we are not violating OCP is we always code to abstraction and not ton concretion
