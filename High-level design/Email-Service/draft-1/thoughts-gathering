GateWay -> Acts as interaction layer between the client and the services serving the request
AuthService -> Microservice acts as an standalone service to do all validation stuff, exposed APIs to validate a request



Execution of clients request and how design evolves
1. The Gateway need to know what all api the service withing a system serves so that it can route the request to correct
service.

2. Let's say we have a request "www.xyz.com/auth?user-name=7jdeep&passcode=#@32@!#"
On the basis of xyz the domain name DNS return the IP of the system, Now the gateWay needs to route the request to
internal servie which can process the request.

3. 'auth' the part of the url after .com is what gateway can use to identify the same if it know that 'authentication service'
can serve this request.

4. The idea is when a service starts in the system it should register itself to the gateway.

5. We can do that but do we want to put this additional responsibility to the gateway, as it's not just once a service starts
it should register itself to gateway, a service have multiple instances and to be in sync of their status that are they
live or dead, gateway will need to listen their heartbeat, and update liveliness.

6. The better way is to decouple this responsibility to a separate service say "Service Manager", gateway can just get
the service and route the request.

7. Here we are adding extra API call to get service, to improve on that lets add a cache at Gateway, The
"Service Manager" will update the cache when needed and gateway can get service from the cache only.

8. The auth service once receives the request it verifies the username and the passcode if valid it picks the phone number
generates an otp, makes request to notification service to send and notification to the client, If client enters valid
otp within the timely update the user status as verified. else mark verification as False.
