Problems in the implementation defined in violation directory:
-> Each board processor either its projected scoreboard or run rate scoreboard processor are wasting CPU cycle they are
running a while loop continuously and polling data from 'CricketScoreBoardProcessor' class
-> To fix this instead of polling in the respective board processor the 'CricketScoreBoardProcessor' can push the data
 to the respective board processor, in that case they do not need to poll.
-> We can look it as 'CricketScoreBoardProcessor' is a publisher and respective board processors are subscribers
-> 'Observer pattern' is also called as 'Publish Subscribe' a pattern
