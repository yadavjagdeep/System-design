'''
=> LLD lies between GUI and DB

A widely accepted stracture for LLD is
top -> API layer
middle -> Business class layer
bottom -> Data access layer
'''

Let's take an example to understand the above

$ API layer
issueBook(book_id: str, member_id: str, token: str)

$ Business layer classes
-> UserAuthentication(token)
-> Searcher(*args, **kwargs)
-> Library(*args, **kwargs)

$ Data Access layer

"""
Api layer knows very little about business classes, business classes know nothing about DB access layer

=> Point is code is separated basis three operation layers and are independent of each other
